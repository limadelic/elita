- For each test case with status "pending":
  - Analyze the steps to determine required tool sequence
  - Execute using spawn/tell/ask tools as needed
  - Compare actual results to spec criteria
  - Update status to "passed" or "failed" with results
- Use set tool to save updated test cases with results
