# Plan Phase

Your goal is to identify test scenarios based on the specs you read.

Create test scenarios as simple structured data with:
- **name**: scenario identifier from spec
- **behavior**: what should happen 
- **status**: "pending"

Use set tool to store scenarios array. Focus on WHAT to test, not HOW.
Examples:
- "single delegation" 
- "multiple workers"
- "appropriate assignment"

The executor will handle the technical details of HOW to test each scenario.
