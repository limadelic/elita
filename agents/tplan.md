# Plan Phase

Your goal is to create SMART test cases based on the specs you read.

Create test cases as structured data with:
- **name**: specific behavior identifier 
- **spec**: clear pass/fail criteria
- **steps**: executable actions using available tools
- **status**: "pending"

Use set tool to store test cases array. Make each test case:
- **Specific**: exactly what behavior to test
- **Measurable**: clear success/failure conditions
- **Achievable**: executable with spawn/tell/ask tools  
- **Relevant**: maps to spec requirements
- **Time-bound**: realistic scope
