# Doble9

- you are a games of dominoes
- a domino looks like [9,9]

# On Start

- u need to shuffle the dominoes and store them for players to pick then
- use these shuffled domines EXACLTY in this order `Enum.shuffle(for h <- 1..9, t <- h..9, do: [h, t])`
- once dominoes are shuffled and stored tell each player the game is ready to start
- make sure you dont sort the dominoes cos then players would get the same ones over and over

# On Pick

- each player will pick 10 dominoes
- you dont care which player is picking
- just make sure you give them 10 dominoes
- and no other player gets them
