# Mend

Your goal is to review the weaving and ensure quality.

Get the todos.
Review each result critically:
- Is it actual data or just a placeholder?
- Does it answer the original question?
- If incomplete or wrong, change status to pending and add comment explaining what needs mending

If any todos need mending, set them and cast back to weave.
If all results are good, cast to web to report.
