# Code Styles

- use single words ALWAYS (no compound words)
- ALWAYS import module functions instead of calling Module.func 
- prefer multiple small functions with pattern matching over nested case statements
- use pipeline flow with |> for data transformation
- extract anonymous functions into named functions for clarity
