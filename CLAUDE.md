# Code Styles

- use single words ALWAYS (no compound words)
- import module functions instead of calling Module.func (only import what you use)
- remove all parenths that can b removed (keep where syntax requires)
- prefer multiple small functions with pattern matching over nested case statements
- use pipeline flow with |> for data transformation
- extract anonymous functions into named functions for clarity
